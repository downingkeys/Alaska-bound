        We are headed to Tito's home state of Alaska to celebrate Nate Vick's 40th Birthday! Nate (45) has been wanting to celebrate his 40th birthday in Alaska <em>for the past 5 years</em>; so now we're going.
      </p>
      <p>
        Follow along with us to see if we manage to get there and back without <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJAVe57yH-o">being mauled by a grizzly</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6O_js_Ucg">eaten by mosquitos</a>, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iFOVi0vJGU">falling off Danali</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        Nate, Tito, and Tim have been friends for decades. Their families go camping together several times a year, and they like to go backpacking when life permits.

    <h2>THE EXPLORERS</h2>
    <p>
      Alaska Bound is taking place in July of 2022. Nate reached out to his two co-travelers in 2020 to plan this trip, but world events have not cooperated with our travel plans until now.

            Known for his esoteric humor, high life competence, and unrivaled care for his people, Nate is the Birthday Boy, and the chief architect of the Alaska Bound trip.

             Nate also co-owns <a href="http://hint.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Hint</em></a>, a software consultancy based in the greater Portland, OR area. Rumors that he's secretly a supervillain are slightly exaggerated.

            When he's not literally saving the lives of lost hikers--his own included, or feeding the hungry with his job at the Clark County <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Food Bank</a>, you can find Tito building his own sauna, fixing his (or a friend's) vehicle, or developing a new skill to put to good use.

            Tim has spent his life as a musician. After COVID seperated him from his touring income, and a house fire seperated him from his piano, Tim decided it was time to learn to code. What you're looking at is Tim's <em>first attemt</em> at a real live website.
