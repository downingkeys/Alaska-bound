        We are headed to Tito's home state of Alaska to celebrate Nate Vick's 40th Birthday! Nate (45) has been wanting to celebrate his 40th birthday in Alaska <em>for the past 5 years</em>; so now we're going.
      </p>
      <p>
        Follow along with us to see if we manage to get there and back without <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJAVe57yH-o">being mauled by a grizzly</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6O_js_Ucg">eaten by mosquitos</a>, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iFOVi0vJGU">falling off Denali</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        Nate, Tito, and Tim have been friends for decades. Their families go camping together several times a year, and they like to go backpacking whenever life permits.

    <h2>THE EXPLORERS</h2>
    <p>
      Alaska Bound is taking place in July of 2022. Nate reached out to his two co-travelers in 2020 to plan this trip, but world events have not cooperated with our travel plans until now.

            Known for his esoteric humor, hyper-competence, and unrivaled care for "his people", Nate is the Birthday Boy, and the chief architect of the Alaska Bound trip.

             Nate also co-owns <a href="https://hint.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Hint</em></a>, a software consultancy based in the greater Portland, OR area. Rumors that he's secretly a supervillain are slightly exaggerated.

            Tim has spent his life as a musician. After COVID seperated him from his touring income, and a house fire seperated him from his piano, he decided it was time to take Nate's advice and learn to code. What you're looking at is Tim's <em>first attemt</em> at a real live website.
